        <h2> Everyone need Healthy food </h2>
        <p>Healthy food refers to food that contains the right amount of nutrients to keep our body fit. We need healthy
          food to keep ourselves fit.

          Furthermore, healthy food is also very delicious as opposed to popular thinking. Nowadays, kids need to eat
          healthy food more than ever. We must encourage good eating habits so that our future generations will be
          healthy
          and fit.

          Most importantly, the harmful effects of junk food and the positive impact of healthy food must be stressed
          upon.
          People should teach kids from an early age about the same.</p>
