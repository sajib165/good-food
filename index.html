        <h2> Everyone need Healthy food </h2>
        <p>Healthy food refers to food that contains the right amount of nutrients to keep our body fit. We need healthy
          food to keep ourselves fit.

          Furthermore, healthy food is also very delicious as opposed to popular thinking. Nowadays, kids need to eat
          healthy food more than ever. We must encourage good eating habits so that our future generations will be
          healthy
          and fit.

          Most importantly, the harmful effects of junk food and the positive impact of healthy food must be stressed
          upon.
          People should teach kids from an early age about the same.</p>

    <h2>Importance of food</h2>
    <p>Food has a great influence on us and we need to practice a habit of proper diet considering the nutritious value
      of the food. Having food only to fulfill our taste is not a sign of consciousness. As the intake of food is
      important to live, it is better to eat a balanced diet quitting the habit of unhealthy food.

      Many people think that we need to spend more money to have nutritious and healthy food. It is not always true. It
      is very easy to diminish the malnutrition with a minimum knowledge of nutrition. It is easy to arrange and have
      nutritious food by preparing a food list combining our intelligence, knowledge, skill, and experience.</p>
